# color_flash_cards

12/5/2021 - Update:
I've created the random animal card to go along with the color. This is also being loading dynamically through UnSplash.com's free photo API.

The game is now repsponsive so that if you're viewing on mobile devices, the color is on top and the animal is on the bottom.

TO DO LIST -
I need to find out why the API is limiting me to only 10 animals at a time.

I also need to recreate the array so that it's object based and contains the image and the photographers name as per the API's guidelines.

11/14/2021 - Original Creation:
This is a simple javascript game I built for my son who is 2 years old. I noticed one day during the credits of a cartoon that every 6 seconds or so, the credits would change scenes and the background was a different color each time. My son started yelling out the colors "GREEN! RED! BLUE! PURPLE!" and was more interested in naming these colors than the cartoon itself! So I decided to make this Color Flash Card game for him to play with. Hopefully he likes it!

Tested it out and he had a lot of fun with it... for about a minute...

Going forward, I'm going to try and find a database or API I can link to with animal and/or car photos so he can name the color and an image on screen and it might keep his attention more.
