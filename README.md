# color_flash_cards

This is a simple javascript game I built for my son who is 2 years old. I noticed one day during the credits of a cartoon that every 6 seconds or so, the credits would change scenes and the background was a different color each time. My son started yelling out the colors "GREEN! RED! BLUE! PURPLE!" and was more interested in naming these colors than the cartoon itself! So I decided to make this Random Color Flash Card for him to play with. Hopefully he likes it!
